This is one of the first projects that I have made in Java. It falls under the category of a text-based team combat game wherein you can create teams, level up character, use items, and battle other computer-driven teams of your own creation. The mechanics are relatively simple, and I primarily used this project as a way to familiarize myself more with object oriented data structures when I was starting out. All of the user interface is through the terminal.
